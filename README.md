### How to caracterize a problem of machine learning: 

Classification Problem: when the dependent variable is a categorical outcome.

Regression Problem: when the dependent variable is a continuous outcome.

Clustering Problem: when there isn't the dependent variable.

### How to choose the machine learning model to use:
